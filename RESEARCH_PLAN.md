## Goal

A full EMNLP-level research paper.

1. Methods should be clear, easy to understand, and ideally simple.
2. Experiments and evaluations should follow established practices of the area.
3. Baselines should control for as many variables as possible, and cover all related work. 
4. Ablations should cover as many design decisions and magic numbers as possible.
